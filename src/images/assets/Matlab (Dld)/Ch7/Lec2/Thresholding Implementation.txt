***** Image Thresholding *****

In this lecture, we will implement the thresholding function in MATLAB to obtain binary image from grayscale image. Let us begin by reading an input image as:
A = imread('filename.extension

If the read image is RGB, converting it into single-channel intensity image:
A_gray = rgb2gray(A);

The grayscale image needs to be converted to double format which has values in the range [0,1] as:
A_gray = im2double(A_gray);

Threshold value for image thresholding can be either manually selected or obtained from image statistics by using some algorithm. MATLAB has a function which allows automatic generation of threshold value using Otsu's method as:
otsu_level = graythresh(A_gray);
otsu_level gives us the optimal threshold value generated by Otsu's algorithm.

Now to convert intensity image into binary image, MATLAB has a function by the name 'im2bw()' which takes input the intensity image and the threshold level value, which you can provide either by yourself or can be generated by Otsu's method as above.

Implementing threshold operations by threshold levels = 50, 100, 150, 200 as:
B_otsu_thresh = im2bw(A_gray, otsu_level);
B_thresh_50 = im2bw(A_gray, 50);
B_thresh_100 = im2bw(A_gray, 100);
B_thresh_150 = im2bw(A_gray, 150);
B_thresh_200 = im2bw(A_gray, 200);

Thresholded binary images are displayed side-by-side for comparison.
