***** Plotting histogram of an image - imhist() *****

Histogram of a single channel image can be plotted using the matlab function "imshist()". 

First let us read a single channel image.
A = imread('filename.extension');

Histogram plotting function works on a single channel of image, therefore, if read image A is single channel then its histogram can be diplayed as:
figure, imhist(A), title('Histogram of read image');

Else if it is 3 channel image, the histogram of individual image channels can be displayed as:
figure, imhist(A(:, :, 1)), tile('Histogram of 1st channel of read image');
figure, imhist(A(:, :, 2)), tile('Histogram of 2nd channel of read image');
figure, imhist(A(:, :, 3)), tile('Histogram of 3rd channel of read image');

By default the imhist() function calculates the histogram for the intensity image I and displays a plot of the histogram. The number of bins in the histogram is determined by the image type.
If I is a grayscale or single channel image, imhist uses a default value of 256 bins.
If I is a binary image, imhist uses two bins.

If you want to select number of bins by yourself, you can display the image histogram as:
figure, imhist(A, n), title('Histogram of read image with n bins');
where n is the number of bins you would like to use for displaying your image histogram. However, for binary images value of n is fixed, i.e., 2.
