***** Reading an image - color or grayscale - imread() *****

MATLAB can read images as color or grayscale. Color images are generally 3-channel images with separate channels for each color, 
for eg., RGB image has individual color channels for R, G & B.

MATLAB Function.
A = imread('filename.extension');

The return value A is an array containing the image data. If the file contains a grayscale image, A is an M-by-N array. If the file contains a truecolor image, A is an M-by-N-by-3 array. M and N are height (no. of rows) and width (no. of columns) respectively of the read image.

File extension is the extension associated with a file type. For e.g., for JPEG files it is .jpg, for BMP files it is .bmp, etc.

Now if you want to display the read image, the command would be:
figure, imshow(A);

Getting to know image height, width and number of channels.
height = size(A, 1);
width = size(A, 2);
number_of_channels = size(A, 3); = 3 for RGB images and 1 for grayscale images

COMPLETE CODE:
A = imread('filename.extension');
figure, imshow(A);
height = size(A, 1);
width = size(A, 2);
number_of_channels = size(A, 3);
