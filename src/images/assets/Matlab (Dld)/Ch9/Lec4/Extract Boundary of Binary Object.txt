***** Morphological image operations - Extract binary object boundary *****

In this lecture, we will learn how to extract boundary of binary object using morphological image operations. Boundary of a binary object in an image can be extracted by subtracting the eroded image from the original image.

Let us begin by reading an input image as:
A = imread('filename.extension');
The read image need to binary and single channel image.

Generate a disk shaped structuring element using MATLAB function as:
se = strel('disk', 5);

Now perform image erosion using MATLAB's function 'imerode()' to generate eroded image as:
B_eroded = imerode(A, se);

In order to get the boundary of binary object, subtract the eroded image from the original image:
B_boundary = A - B_eroded;

Now the generated image will have the boundary of the binary object highlighted.

The above task can be similarly performed by using image dilation. First think about it yourself. MATLAB code for it has been provided with this lecture.
