***** Morphological image operations - Opening and Closing *****

In last lecture, we learnt about image erosion and dilation. In this lecture, we will learn about how to perform image opening and closing in MATLAB. 

As you may recall from our first lecture in this chapter, 
1. Image opening => image erosion followed by dilation
2. Image closing => image dilation followed by erosion

Let us begin with reading an input image as:
A = imread('filename.extension');
If the read image is not single channel, convert it to single channel image.

Now let us initialize structuring element for our use, which you may recall from out last lecture MATLAB has a function by the name 'strel()' which generates structuring element of various predefined shapes and sizes. This can be implemented as:
se = strel('disk', 15); 
This generates disk type structuring element with 15 pixels as diameter.

For image opening, MATLAB has a function by the name 'imopen()' which can be used as:
B_open = imopen(A, se);

Similarly for image closing:
B_close = imclose(A, se);

Now display the original and processed images side-by-side for comparison.
