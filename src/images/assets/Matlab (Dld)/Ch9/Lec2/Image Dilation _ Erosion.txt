***** Morphological image operations - Erosion & Dilation *****

In this lecture, we will learn to perform two morphological image operations which are erosion and dilation. Let us being with reading an input image as:
A = imread('filename.extension');
The read image needs to be single-channel image.

We will need a structuring element for performing these operations. MATLAB has a function 'strel()' for generating structuring element as:
se = strel('disk', 15); 
This generates disk type structuring element with 15 pixels as diameter.

For erosion, MATLAB has a function by the name 'imerode()' which can be used as:
B_eroded = imerode(A, se);

Similarly for dilation, MATLAB has a function by the name 'imdilate()' which can be used as:
B_dilated = imdilate(A, se);

Display original, eroded and dilated images side-by-side to observe the effect.
